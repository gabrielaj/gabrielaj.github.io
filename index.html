<h1> so it all started when i was entering high school. my best friend stopped being my best friend 
and became a stranger. she changed soo soo much! it was unbelievable </h1>

done too bad </h4>

beginning. hope college is full of excitement and wonderful journeys </h4>
<h5> I plan  on majoring on social work and change the life of many troubled children. i want to
change the life of those who more need it!! </h5>
<h6>i dont need to be rich but i do want to life comfortable. its important to me because 
i feel like rich people arent always happy depsite all the money thy appear to have. 
<p> life is too short to not be happy or to have to deal with unnecessary shit.
