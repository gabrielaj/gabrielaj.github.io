<h1> so it all started when I was entering high school. my best friend stopped being my best friend 
and became a stranger. she changed soo soo much! it was unbelievable </h1>
<h2> her name is Nyasha. we were inseparable. but she just changed too fast on me </h3>
<h3> my other best friend was chisom. she still the same so im always happy to she her. 
shes always happy, therefore its always a blessing to see her around </h3>
<h4> moving on, i cant wait to graduate. its a blessing to thing back and realize I haven't
done too bad </h4>
<h4> june 12 will be memorable. the day i can put all the bad in the past and look forward to a better 
beginning. hope college is full of excitement and wonderful journeys </h4>
<h5> I plan  on majoring on social work and change the life of many troubled children <a href= ".http://www.trinitydc.edu/"
> IMDB </a> i want to
change the life of those who more need it!! </h5>
<h6>I don't need to be rich but i do want to life comfortable. its important to me because 
I feel like rich people arent always happy depsite all the money thy appear to have. 
<p> life is too short to not be happy or to have to deal with unnecessary shit, wouldn't </p>
<p> treat people how you want to be treated should be everyone's motto! if you want respect you look for
 it and you earn it by also giving it </p>
